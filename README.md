# Dymond
Gorgeous, minimal, diamond-shaped icons for your iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

**Works on iOS 7 and 8**

##A unique look
Dymonds will be everyoneâ€™s best friend. It was first released in iOS 6 and back then it was ahead of its time. With the introduction of iOS 7's minimal style, Dymond feels in place. 

Gorgeous, diamond-shaped icons that make every app stand out. 

With support for many tweaks (and more coming) and more than 300 apps, Dymond is the best minimal icon replacement you can get.
